      <h3> <br>About me! <br><br> </h3>

   <div style="text-align: center;">
    <p><p>My name is NGBlock. I'm from germany and a teen who is doing all types of <br>
    projects! My current project is to host a website [the one you are on right<br>
    now!] using a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of ram!</a> [image 1.1] which you can buy <br>
    through the website I linked! I code stuff in Java and just bought a book about <br>
    the basics of C++. I love coding, which is my main hobby and even visited a <br>
    programming school in the past. I have other hobbys tho, like playing the <br>
    piano or playing video games and sketching!</p>

    <h3> <br>The Games I play!<br><br></h3>

    <p>I've made a spread sheet of all the games I own and what playtime I have! However <br>
       the games i mainly play are Geometry Dash, Minecraft [especially technological <br>
       Modpacks where you build nuclear reactors or do stuff with chemistry] Which is why <br>
       I also love to play Factorio and Satisfactory! I play both on PC and on my Playstation!</p>
